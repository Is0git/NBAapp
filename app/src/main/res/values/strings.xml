    <string name="news_text">Game 6 of the 2019 NBA Finals, Golden State Warriors star Klay Thompson suffered a torn left ACL that has left him sidelined ever since. When training camp opened late last month, the Warriors were holding out hope Thompson could possibly return sometime after the All-Star break.

Coach Steve Kerr, in an interview with Logan Murdock of NBC Sports BayArea released Tuesday morning, says Thompson may not play at all in the 2019-20 campaign.

"Generally an ACL for a basketball player is a full year recovery," Kerr said. "And if it's a full year for Klay, that puts him out for the season. We've kind of left the door open in case the rehab goes perfectly and the doctors say he can go. The reality is on April 1, that's the nine-month mark, he got his surgery on July 1. April 1 is nine months post-op for an ACL ... it's unlikely that he's going to play this year."
